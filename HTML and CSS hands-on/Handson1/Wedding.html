          A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage.
          Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic
          groups, religions, countries, and social classes. Most wedding
          ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by a couple,
          presentation of a gift and a public proclamation of marriage by an
          authority figure or celebrant.

          Some cultures have adopted the traditional Western custom of the white
          wedding, in which a bride wears a white wedding dress and veil. This
          tradition was popularized through the marriage of Queen Victoria. Some
          say Victoria's choice of a white gown may have simply been a sign of
          extravagance, but may have also been influenced by the values she held
          which emphasized sexual purity. Within the modern 'white wedding'
          tradition, a white dress and veil are unusual choices for a woman's
          second or subsequent wedding.
