          Corporate entertainment describes private events held by corporations
          or businesses for their staff, clients or stakeholders. These events
          can be for large audiences such as conventions and conferences, or
          smaller events such as retreats, holiday parties or even private
          concerts. It is also commonly used to mean corporate hospitality, the
          process of entertaining guests at corporate events.

          There are various types of corporate events that make use of
          entertainment. An opening general session may include entertainment
          that adds excitement and presents the overall theme of the meeting.
          Mixers or pre-dinner parties many times use entertainment meant to
          provide a backdrop for conversation, perhaps an acoustic ensemble or
          pre-recorded music.
