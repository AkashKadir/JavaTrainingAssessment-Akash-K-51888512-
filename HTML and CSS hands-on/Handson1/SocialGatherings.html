          A party is a gathering of people who have been invited by a host for
          the purposes of socializing, conversation, recreation, or as part of a
          festival or other commemoration of a special occasion. A party will
          typically feature food and beverages, and often music and dancing or
          other forms of entertainment.

        <p>
          Some parties are held in honor of a specific person, day, or event,
          such as a birthday party, a Super Bowl party, or a St. Patrickâ€™s Day
          party. Parties of this kind are often called celebrations. A party is
          not necessarily a private occasion. Public parties are sometimes held
          in restaurants, pubs, beer gardens, nightclubs or bars, and people
          attending such parties may be charged an admission fee by the host.
